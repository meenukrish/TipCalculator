# TipCalculator
This is a Javascript application to calculate your restaurant tip.

Your task is to create a front-end JavaScript application that will help calculate a tip at a restaurant for your server. 
However, your application :

* Take in the value of the bill

* Take in the desired tip percentage

* Include the option to split the tip amount by number of people at the table

 * The application should then calculate the amount of tip per table (or per person if the split option is chosen) and 
 return that value to the user.
